# Hirst-Painting
This project is inspired by the dot paintings of artist Damien Hirst. It uses the Python turtle module to create a grid of colored dots, with colors extracted from an image file using the 'colorgram' library.

## Features

- Extract colors from an image using the `colorgram` library.
- Use the `turtle` module to create a grid of colored dots.

## Installation

- To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You will also need to install the `colorgram` library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install colorgram.py
```

- There's no need to install `turtle` library as it is pre-installed with Python.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeetRadadiya2210/Hirst-Painting.git
cd Hirst-Painting
```

2. The other image file named `image.jpg` in the `Hirst-Painting` Repository will be used to extract colors.

3. Run the `main.py` script.

```bash
python main.py
```
